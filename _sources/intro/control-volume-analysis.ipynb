    " 1. In general, flow is three-dimensional and unsteady, so $V = f(t, x, y, z)$\n",
    " 2. If we assume a flow is two-dimensional and unsteady, then $V = f(t, x, y)$\n",
    " 3. We can next assume the flow is unsteady and one-dimensional:  $V = f(t, x)$\n",
    " 4. Finally, we can assume one-dimensional steaedy flow: $V = f(x)$\n",
